                                I came from a Bangla medium curriculum. In our graduation level we had all the text books and lectures written in English language. At that time we had to learn a lot of new words. At the beginning of my graduation it occurred to me that finding words in dictionaries is harder than learning meaning of any word. I am sure that all the students that come from Bangla medium face this sort of problem and they hate this. Then I was looking for an alternative to solve this problem. In our time I did not get any good solution. I was involved in two clubs (Computer Club and Language Club) in my university. At that time I was practicing PHP at home. To find a word manually I used famous English to Bangla dictionary called "Bangla Academy English to Bangla Dictionary". It is very good English to Bangla dictionary. Then I had the idea to create computer software that will find word meaning for me and it has to be English to Bangla dictionary. At that time I planned to do it. Then I discussed it with Rebeka. Rebeka was the president of Language Club at that time. She helped to find volunteers from Language Club who helped to insert all the words manually using my software. I used PHP programming language to manage the dictionary data manipulation. Finally when we finished the project we decided to use it within our club members. Day by day the demand was growing in our university. Then we decided to release the software as an online version.
                                </p>

                                It gives word meaning within seconds. It can search meaning for both English to Bangla and Bangla to English. It has a unique feature called "Read Text". We read a lot in websites; during our reading we find a lot of unknown words. To use this feature a user just has to copy any text from anywhere and paste it in the "Read Text" tab then a page will appear containing the text. Then the user will has to just double click on any unknown word to see word meaning. This dictionary also has two extensions for Firefox and Chrome. If a user installs the extension in any of these two browsers then he will have the opportunity to see any word meaning in any page. For instance, if a user reads the Daily Star and the browser extension is installed then he can get meaning of any word just clicking twice on any word. It is a simple process but helps a user to learn a lot of new word meanings within a minimal time.

                                The basic difference is other dictionaries are just dictionaries.

                                Our society needs more automation in education system. Our govt. is trying to digitize all the books so that students get the digital books conveniently.
